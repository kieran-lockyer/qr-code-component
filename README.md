## My process
Given that this challenge is very simple, this has been an exercise in learning Figma as a developer.
My process was to navigate the figma application to find useful information like font-family, border-radius and padding sizes etc.
After that it was a straightforward implementation of the designs into html and css.

### Built with

- html
- CSS

### What I learned

Where properties such as font-family are viewable in figma, and how to use keyboard shortcuts to measure distances between elements.

### Useful resources

- [Figma Resources](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/360039956974-Measure-distances-between-layers) - Where I found handy Figma shortcuts.
